It is possible that a man can fly
Bend his body late into the night
It is possible that if he tries
Make a fool of science, gravity and flight

If you're searching for the right choice
Searching for something that will make you feel alright
Take a look deep down inside yourself
Just move your feet and let the music do the rest

Well, the music's hot, it just won't stop
Everybody dance to the radio rock
The music's hot, it just won't stop
Everybody dancing

They all baptize the beat
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

They all baptize the beat
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

He's back out on the street again tonight
Twisting body with all his might
It's impossible, the things he does
Grab onto your dream, ride that shooting star

If you're searching for the right choice
Searching for something that will make you feel alright
Take a look deep down inside yourself
Just move your feet and let the music do the rest

Well, the music's hot, it just won't stop
Everybody dance to the radio rock
The music's hot, it just won't stop
Everybody dancing

They all baptize the beat
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

They all baptize the beat
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

They all baptize the beat
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

They all baptize the beat
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

They all baptize the beat

And let your body work
And let your body work
Come to church and let your body work

He-ey-ey
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

He-ey-ey,
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

He-ey-ey, yeah
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

He-ey-ey, yeah

(4x)
Baptize the beat
Baptize the beat-uh

Said, the deejays baptize the beat

(8x)
Baptize the beat

If you're searching for the right choice
Searching for something that will make you feel alright
Take a look deep down inside yourself
Just move your feet and let the music do the rest

Well, the music's hot, it just won't stop...
