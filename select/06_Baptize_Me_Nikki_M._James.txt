NABULUNGI
Well then, would you like to baptize me?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Pffttt sure, yeah, that would be great.

NABULUNGI
OK, let's do it.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
What, you mean now?

NABULUNGI
Why not?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Well, to be honest, I've... I've never done it before.

NABULUNGI
That's OK, neither have I!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Nahahahah! Yes, that's true.

NABULUNGI
Do you know how to baptize someone into the church?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Sure, that's something we study over and over again at mission control center.

NABULUNGI
Then please, Elder Cunningham, I want to be baptized. I swear to dedicate my life to the Church.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Huh, OK. I just need a second to get ready.

NABULUNGI
OK. I will get ready too!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I'm about to do it for the first time
And I'm gonna do it with a girl
A special girl who makes my heart kinda flutter
Makes my eyes kinda blur
I can't believe I'm about to baptize her

NABULUNGI
He will baptize me
He will hold me in his arms
And he will baptize me
Right in front of everyone
And it will set me free
When he looks into my eyes
And he sees just how much
I love being baptized

ELDER CUNNINGHAM (NABULUNGI)
I'm gonna baptize her (Baptize me)
Bathe her in God's glory
And I will baptize her (I'm ready)
With everything I got
And I'll make her beg for more (Oooh)
As I wash her free of sin
And it'll be so good
She'll want me to baptize her again (Baptize me again)

Excuse me, I, I need another minute!

NABULUNGI
Never known a boy so gentle
One like him is hard to find
A special kind, he makes my heart kind of flutter
Like a moth in a cocoon
I hope he gets to baptizing me soon!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I'm gonna baptize you
I'm through with all my stallin'

NABULUNGI
You're gonna baptize me
I'm ready to let you do it

NABULUNGI and ELDER CUNNINGHAM
And it will set us free
It's time to be immersed
And I'm so happy you're about to be my first

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
OK. Are you ready?

NABULUNGI
I am... ready. So how do we do it?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM (NABULUNGI)
Well, I hold you like this (Yeah?)
And I lower you down (Yeah?)
And then I—

I just baptized her
She got dowsed by heavenly father
I just baptized her good (Baptized me)
I performed like a champ!

NABULUNGI
I'm wet with salvation

NABULUNGI and ELDER CUNNINGHAM
We just went all the way
Praise be to God
I'll never forget this day

I baptized you (You baptized me)
I gotcha good (Baptized me)
You are a Mormon (Baptized me)

NABULUNGI
I'll text you later.
