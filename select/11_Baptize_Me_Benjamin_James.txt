Baptize me where the wind sings new songs
And flows deep in my lungs, to breathe Kingdom come
Baptize me when the rain falls on the sea
And stairs back at me, baptize me
Baptize me in the heat of the burning sun
That causes all growth to come, where death and life are one
Baptize me with the birds in the morning
With the leaves in their turning, baptize me

In what was, in what is, in what's coming
Baptize me

Baptize me up in the mountains
Through rivers up fountains,
Through the forest surrounding
Baptize me in the eyes of my brother
In the love of my mother, baptize me
